      - A lot of small fixes in several libraries and applications (see my GitHub account history)

  - title: Programming interests
    layout: text
    content: |
      I had and have different interests in different computer science areas. Some years ago I was crazy about image pre and post-OCR processing. I was reading a lot of papers and articles and even implemented PRLIB. But this area is too specific (at least I think so) and later I switched to another area: compilers and static analysis. Mostly I was (and a little am) interested in compiler optimizations and static analysis problems (you can check my diploma project).

      Now for me is interesting to design and develop modern cloud-based highly-scalable high-performance (throughput and latency) systems. Also, interested in building robust socio-technical systems.
